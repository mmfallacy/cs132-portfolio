Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino Jr. is a notable Filipino politician, journalist, and major rival of the late President Ferdinand Marcos Sr. Due to his previous charges of murder, illegal possession of firearms, and subversion during Martial Law and his informal relations with Jose Sison, some people now associate him as communist, co-founder of NPA, traitor, and the likes. In light of this, the team would like to gain insight into the impact of misinformation on public perceptions and beliefs by analyzing these Tweets's sentiments.

# Problem Formulation

## Research Question
What is the sentiment of tweets spreading misinformation about Ninoy Aquino's alleged links to the NPA, communism, and the Plaza Miranda bombing? 
## (Alternative) Hypothesis
Tweets spreading misinformation about Ninoy Aquino's alleged links to the NPA, communism, and the Plaza Miranda bombing are **more likely to be negative** in sentiment.
## Null Hypothesis
There is **no prevailing sentiment** in tweets spreading misinformation about Ninoy Aquino's alleged links to the NPA, communism, and the Plaza Miranda bombing.
## Action Plan
**Categorize tweets** spreading misinformation about Ninoy Aquino's alleged links to the NPA, communism, and the Plaza Miranda bombing into positive, negative, or neutral categories based on sentiment analysis
