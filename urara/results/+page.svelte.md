## What did we find out?
The tweets spreading misinformation about Ninoy Aquinoâ€™s alleged links to the NPA, communism, and the Plaza Miranda bombing are indeed negative in sentiment.

## Why should we care?
We can use this finding to lead to more questions regarding the topic like:
- Are the proponents of these negative tweets trolls or actual people?
- Are these tweets a response to some event or propaganda?
- Are the tweets unique or the idea is being restated across many accounts?

This can then lead to more insights as to why misinformation is being spread.

## How does this fit into what we already know?
We know that being a politician attracts issues and controversy. As we navigate through their political career, we can see how such allegations can affect public's opinion and perception.

## Then what?
The impact of this study is to see how an individual can see one of the many applications of data science and how it is used to address misinformation.

Furthermore, findings from this study can be applied to other notable figures for them to be aware of the trend and current public's opinion on them and how they will be able to tackle it.

## Ending remark
We can use data science and automation to quickly analyze and detect patterns, trends, behaviors.

What we can do now is looking more into this topic by answering some of the questions listed above.
